# More Polygon Subdivision

I was inspired to take a try at polygon subdivision again by reading a wonderful [post from Pier Pasma](https://piterpasma.nl/articles/polysub). The idea is to start with a square, divide it roughly in half, and repeat the process for each new polygon added to the sketch n times. 

See the outputs [here](https://fjaddison.github.io/more-polygon-subdivision/).
